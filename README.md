# Cyber_Attack_3D
A basic Adventure game. 

My Goals for this project:
1. create the background
2. create the player(s)
3. create a menu start up
4. Allow the character to pick up objects 
5. Allow character to move on the plane 
6. Optional: Allow the character to have dialogue with AI characters. 

This is still a working progress and I hope to develop more to this game. 

Thank you for reading.
